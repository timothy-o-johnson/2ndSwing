Relevant deployment: app/common/scripting/scriptrecord.nl?id=205

How Form Works
form is called 'form'

'titler' seems to be mispelling of titler
parameters from deployments are accessed via 
    runtime.getCurrentScript()
		    .getParameter({
				name : "custscript_wms_find_nextstep_so"
					})

    where name equals fieldId

field group for the filters?
orderList = all the Sales Orders = a sublist created by form.addSublist()
addField() creates the field (column headings)
setSublistValue() populates each line

form.clientScriptModulePath = './TransferOrderPickLineHelperPromise.js'
