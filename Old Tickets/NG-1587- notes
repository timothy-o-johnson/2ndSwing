To Do
o test full-search 
o load search into file cabinet
o practice access file
o document process 
    - create saved search in sandbox/live 
        - ensure it's behaving as you would like 
        - use the saved search tool to download it
            - erase the extraneous bits 
            """ var searchResultCount = purchaseorderSearchObj.runPaged().count;
            """ log.debug("purchaseorderSearchObj result count",searchResultCount);
            """ purchaseorderSearchObj.run().each(function(result){
            """ // .run().each has a limit of 4,000 results
            """ return true;
            """ });" 
        - update/add it to the library ('/SuiteScripts/WMS/shared/SavedSearchLibrary.js')
        - name the search by id (i.e. 'customsearch_wms_receivingsearch_3' )
            - easier for finding the actual search in NS
        - save the search title in the comments
        - add the name of the search to the return object
    - going forward transition over to system as you need to make changes
